# kryptonite
The ultimate browser - built based on the principles from DuckDuckGo to create a wall of privacy, speed and security without Tor, unlike most modern browsers including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Opera.

## What will this do?
When the project is completed it is intended to be an integration of DuckDuckGo into a web browser (similar to how Google is integrated into Chrome) including normal browser features like history, HTML5 interpretation and incognito mode. Kryptonite, however is intended to have VirusTotal API integration, scanning files before they are downloaded and giving the user a warning if over 10% of AV's detect the file in question. Currently this is only supported by Windows and is being made in Visual Studio, however Linux and Mac versions will hopefully be finished after a working Windows release is completed. It is important to note that this browser is being made completely from scratch.

## How can I help?
We are currently in need of help to complete the following features:
  * HTML interpretation.
  * VirusTotal API integration.
  * DuckDuckGo instant-answer API integration into top-bar search.
  * HTTPS-Everywhere-like algorithm integration.

## Hitlist of upcoming features
  * ~~HTML text reading.~~
  * DuckDuckGo instant-answer API integration.
  * ~~Automatic scam detection.~~ (Can detect Apple and Microsoft tech support scams with high accuracy, filter can still always be improved upon though!)
  * Automatic virus scanner.
